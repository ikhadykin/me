## Books I've read

This repo is a place where I keep my notes about all tech related books I've read or reading right now. The notes themselves are not complete and they are very subjective, an actual book will be required to fully grasp the author's ideas and intent. If you find this notes useful in any way, I encourage you to buy the book and make your own notes.
